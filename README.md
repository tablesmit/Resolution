# Resolution
I updated this csharp project from codeproject so that it supports two monitors instead of one -- which seemed more complicated than it should’ve been. I couldn’t seem to find a full solution for multiple monitors like this anywhere else -- this one supports infinite monitors. Theoretically, it would work on a giant monitor wall. It can even be used as a base class for changing any display configuration setting, not just resolution.

So hopefully it helps someone else.
