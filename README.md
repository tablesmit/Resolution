# Resolution
I updated this csharp project from codeproject so that it supports two monitors instead of one -- which seemed way more ridiculous and complicated than it should’ve been. I couldn’t seem to find a full solution for multiple monitors like this anywhere else -- this one supports infinite monitors. Theoretically, it would work on a giant monitor wall. 

So hopefully it helps someone else.
